        <p>ado.sql limited is no longer operating and it is time for my professional/personal blog site to be removed</p>
	<p>I don't see any benefit in continuing paying for the hosting of the site as it hasn't been updated for a while 
		and a lot of the content is somewhat dated now. Much of the technical articles can be gleaned from other online sources fairly easily</p>
	    <p>As such this will just serve as a landing page for adosql.com, olcot.com and olcot.co.uk until I decide what to do 
	    with the domains in the longer term</p>
<p>If you do want to get hold of me specifically, you can easily find me elsewhere on the web - I'm not that difficult to find.. I'd start with LinkedIn ;-)</p>
